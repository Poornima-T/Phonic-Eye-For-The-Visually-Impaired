Visual disability is physical abnormality that deters person from performing activities due to lack of awareness about surroundings. Though there are numerous applications built for the visually impaired, the goal of the proposed solution is to create an interactive mobile application based on the object detection technology to report the user about the vicinity. This mobile application serves as an effective tool in enhancing the experience of the user by capturing the image of the scene in the environment and identifying the objects in the frame with the application of Convolutional Neural Networks based on faster Region CNN model and the results are converted to speech signals and are delivered to the user in the form of voice prompt thereby enabling the users to be self reliant and phonetically observe the locale.
